I'm a Data Science & Machine Learning Practioner with a wide range of experience in Tensforflow, Scikit-Learn and top performing models such as Catboost, XGBoost and LightGBM.

- [Automated Scorecard Processing Handwritten Character Recognition](https://tophercollins.github.io/handwritten-character-recognition.html), Computer Vison model for custom EMNIST character recognition including artificially constructed strikethrough characters.
- [Smoker vs. Non-Smoker Classification](https://tophercollins.github.io/smoker-classification.html), a classification model using Tenserflow, Catboost, XGBoost, & LightGBM for an ensemble stacking classfier.
- [Fine-tuning LLM for RPG Statblocks](https://tophercollins.github.io/rpg-statblock-generator.html), fine-tuned Llama3 model for producing Dungeons & Dragons monster statblocks, dataset and model deployed on Hugging Face.
- [Electric Vehicle kWh Consumption Forecasting](https://tophercollins.github.io/ev-kwh-consumption-forecasting.html), explored forecasting daily kWh consumption for a workplace EV charging program.
- **Bitcoin Price Forecasting**, implemented time series models (Conv1D, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU) for Bitcoin price forecasting, using metrics (Loss, MAE, MSE) to assess performance.
- **Structured Medical Text Classification with NLP**, a multi-class model utilizing Universal Sentence Encoder, Conv1D character embedding, and text position features to classify medical literature sentences.
- **Transfer Learning in Food Image Classification**, computer vision model on Food101 dataset utilizing EfficientNetV2 transfer learning.
- [D&D Race Classification](https://tophercollins.github.io/dnd-race-classification.html), a classification problem using Scikit-learn library and models.

I'm also a Dungeons & Dragons / Tabletop RPG / Gaming nerd who utilises programming for building gaming related passion projects.

- [DnDwithToph.com](https://dndwithtoph.com/), a Dungeons & Dragons platform for online gameplay & adventures using a Flask framework.
- [Zombie Survival](https://tophercollins.github.io/zombie-survival.html), a turn based survival game written in Python focusing on Object Orientated Programming.
