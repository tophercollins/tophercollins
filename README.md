### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Dungeons & Dragons nerd who utilises programming to build tools to improve my areas of passion.

- [DnDwithToph.com](https://dndwithtoph.com/), a Dungeons & Dragons platform for online gameplay & adventures.
- [Zombie Survival](https://tophercollins.github.io/zombie-survival.html), a replication of a turn based survival board game.
